# Robust Human Target Detection and Acquisition

Welcome to the repository for **Robust Human Target Detection and Acquisition**. This project aims to enhance the accuracy of human activity recognition and improve the resilience of human target tracking, especially in complex and occluded security environments.

## Project Overview

This system addresses key challenges in surveillance scenarios:
- **Activity Recognition**: Identifies specific human behaviors like walking, running, or jumping to assess potential security threats.
- **Target Tracking**: Maintains track continuity even when individuals are occluded or temporarily out of the frame.

The project leverages multi-object tracking and re-identification techniques to ensure robust, uninterrupted surveillance. Features such as color histograms from bounding boxes help in tracking individuals despite occlusions, adapting to dynamic environments, lighting changes, and other real-world challenges.

## Key Features
- **Occlusion Handling**: Techniques to mitigate occlusions and ensure consistent tracking.
- **Deep Learning for Activity Recognition**: Utilizes rich feature representations from deep learning to identify activities.
- **Appearance Features**: Enhanced tracking through the extraction of appearance-based features like color and texture.
- **Real-World Adaptability**: Models are designed to perform in various real-world environments, making them suitable for public surveillance, critical infrastructure protection, and security applications.

## Ethical Considerations

We acknowledge the importance of ethical use in surveillance technology. Our project is committed to:
- Privacy preservation and legal compliance.
- Mitigating bias and ensuring transparency in decision-making.

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, the project aims to explore:
- Emerging surveillance technologies.
- Broader applications in security domains.
- Addressing ethical implications and societal impact of widespread surveillance systems.

## Versions

The repository contains two versions of the project, each with its own README file:
- **Version 1**: The older implementation with initial methodologies.
- **Version 2**: The improved version with advanced tracking and activity recognition techniques.
